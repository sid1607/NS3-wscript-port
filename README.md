# Porting NS-3 components from Python 2.7 to Python 3.3

This project mainly focuses on porting the wscript files used by the [WAF](https://code.google.com/p/waf/) build tool.

The first phase involves the usage of the automated [Python 2to3 code translation program](https://docs.python.org/2/library/2to3.html).
